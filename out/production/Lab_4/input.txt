Our father is Bandera Stepan Andriiovych, Ukraine is a mother, we will fight for Ukraine!
Oh, in the forest, the forest, under the green oak, there lies a rebel badly wounded.
Oh, he lies, he lies, he suffers great torments, without the left foot, without the right hand.
When his mother came to him, he cries and weeps, pities him.
Oh, my son, my son, I have already won, he was left without a right handle, without a leg.
Our mothers, mothers, do not weep for us, do not weep for us with bitter tears.
Our father is Bandera Stepan Andriiovych, Ukraine is a mother, we will fight for Ukraine!
And we lived with the Muscovites and did not agree, we went into battle with Peter himself.
The Muscovites fled until they lost their shoes, and our shots were fired after them.
Our father is Bandera Stepan Andriiovych, Ukraine is a mother, we will fight for Ukraine!
Oh, how a mother buried her son, she wrote the words on his grave.
On his grave the words were written: Glory to Ukraine Glory to all the heroes!
